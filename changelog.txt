= 1.4.7
Fixed the way javascript was injected into the frontend header and replaced it with the proper enqueue script.

= 1.4.6
Changed lazyload assets source location.

= 1.4.5
Changed the order of when html is rewritten and when lazyload is rendered. Also, preventing images to lazyload on homepage to avoid slideshow conflicts of late loading slides.

= 1.4
Now lazyloading all iframes on the website to help improve pagespeed. Most social widgets or Youtube videos are iframes, so this typically is a dramatic improvement.

= 1.3
Fixed compatibility issue with WPtouch. We now disable the CDN only when viewing the site from a mobile device and when WPtouch theme is showing.

= 1.2
Fixed constant GLOBAL_CDN to work better with multisite and the new walled garden option.

= 1.1
Aug 21, 2015 - Added walled garden option. If a blog admin is having a hard time trying to access the frontend of their blog, but the backend is loading fine, then you can try to bypass their local router or ISP's internet access policy (IAP) all together. Some workplace networks have either misconfigured IAP's or are overly restrictive. To bypass, navigate to their blog wp-admin, then to Tools > Walled Garden. More instructions are provided on that page.

= 1.0
Aug 13, 2015 - Initial public release.
